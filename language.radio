TALISMAN_SUMMON1="Now the stranger started talking made it plain to folks around/Was an Arizona ranger wouldn't be too long in town/He came here to take an outlaw/Back alive, or maybe dead";
TALISMAN_SUMMON2="Twenty men had tried to take him/ twenty men had made a slip./Twenty one would be the ranger with/the big iron on his hip";
TALISMAN_SUMMON3="It was over in a moment and the folks had gathered round/There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground/Oh he might have went on living but he made one fatal slip/When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip";
TALISMAN_SUMMON4="Wasn't long before the story was relayed to Texas Red/But the outlaw didn't worry men that tried before were dead/Twenty men had tried to take him twenty men had made a slip/Twenty one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip";
