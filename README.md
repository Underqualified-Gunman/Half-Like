# Half-Like 
A reskin collage for Hideous Destructor themed to the Half-Life Franchise Primarily, With Minor Cameos from other games and mods.
 
 
 A special thanks to ZikShadow for his model shot packs and Tommygalano5's City 17 sprite set respectively. 

Years ago near the end of 2021 when I first started playing HDest I longed for a spas-12 skin to replace the hunter's sprites with a spas-12.
I eventually found TG5's WIP City 17 pack he posted earlier that year.
