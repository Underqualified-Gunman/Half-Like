// random ideas/other cool ideas.
deployable camera that is mounted to cieling,  
has a very large screen and can be aimed pressing fire activates things it aims at. 
drains battery when left on, alt fire to disable like the herp, 
perhaps  have a ping abilty with it? or a spot light mode?

make it so cameras can spawn on floor decor or monster spawn points not replacing the original
look into bntz hackpad
have cameras be hackable
