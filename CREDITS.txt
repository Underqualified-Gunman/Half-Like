All files in the Graphics folder are edited by Accensus (Ace). Used Hideous Destructor's version of those as a base.

Revolver
 - Revolver sprites originally by Solid Steak (https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?p=890579#p890579)
 - Visual edits and barrel rotation by Accensus. Making it work with HD's revolver system is also my doing.
 
Slayer
 - Original sprites by DoomNukem. Long Slayer edit by Ace.

9mm Box
 - Taken from Trailblazer. Edit by Ace.
 
.355 Box
 - Same as above. It's the same sprite, just recolored and flipped.
 
7.76mm Box
 - Yeah, Trailblazer again. Edits by Ace.
